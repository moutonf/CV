\cvitem{supervisors}{Prof H.S. Venter, Dr L. Leenen}
\cvitem{description}{The goal of this research is to further define social engineering and develop attack detection models for social engineering. In order to perform this research, ethical requirements for performing social engineering research are developed. During this research several assisting components are developed: An ontological model for social engineering, a social engineering attack framework and social engineering awareness measurements. Furthermore, social engineering attack detection models are developed for bidirectional communication, uni-directional communication and indirect communication. Using the attack detection models the goal is to improve an individual's resilience against social engineering attacks.}

\cvitem{supervisor}{Prof H.S. Venter}
\cvitem{description}{The contribution of this research is the digital forensic readiness prototype that can be used to add a digital forensics layer to any existing wireless sensor network. The prototype ensures the integrity and authenticity of each of the data packets captured from the wireless sensor network by using the number of nodes in the network that have seen the specific data packet. The prototype does not require any modification to be made on the existing wireless sensor network and is deployed as an additional wireless sensor network. One of the main problems in wireless sensor networks is flooding attacks. The prototype is able to detect flooding attacks and immediately alerts the user and pinpoints the origin of the flooding attack.}
